## [DATA601 - Working with Data and Visualization - Project Olympics](data601_project_olympics)

### Summer Olympic Games Analysis from 1896 to 2020

This notebook is explore and visualize the history of the Olympics from a country and medal standpoint.

some topics we explored are:
1. Which countries have hosted the most Olympics? Which continents have hosted the most Olympics?
2. Is there any relationship between being the host country and the number of medals one country won?
3. Which are the top countries based on the medals they have won? And is the medals tally related to the ecomony of the coutry?
4. Does political events affect the Olympic Games?


## [DATA602 - Statistical Data Analysis - Project Marathon](data602_project_marathon)

### Inferences on Marathon Runner Participation and Performance

This paper attempts to draw relationships and predict performance between gender, age, and/or nationality of citizenship for competitive marathon runners.

Some inferences we explored are:
1. Does gender influence the mean marathon completion time? Does gender influence the variance of marathon completion time? Does age influence the mean marathon completion time?
2. Are the population proportions of men and women finishers equal across continents?
3. As the demographic of marathon runners is seemingly changing, does the age distribution of finishers reflect a normal distribution?
4. Can we establish a relationship between age and performance using simple linear regression?
